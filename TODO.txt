Next up: 
	-Figure out which parts of ExerciseViewModel can be extracted to ExerciseLogic
	-Extend the "OtherView" with the option of creating Custom Exercises
	-Implement Custom Exercise View inside the Exercise frame

Later:
	-Figure out how to bundle up controls
	-


Exercise extension plan:
	Rearrange MainView layout
		- Only the header should be the own of this View
		- The Buttons have to be a child element's controls
		- The CurrentViewModel property has to be kind of "global", because several other views will need to access it
		- The unused View-s has to be Disposed
		- When switching to an other bigger part (e.g. ExerciseView), the buttons should be replaced with that Views' own buttons
		-
