Next up: 
	-Clean up the whole code base
	-Erase hidden dependencies
	-Refactor where it is needed
	-Figure out which parts of ExerciseViewModel can be extracted to ExerciseLogic
	-Change UserControls to simple Views


Later:
	-Figure out how to bundle up controls
	-


Exercise extension plan:
	Rearrange MainView layout
		- Only the header should be the own of this View
		- The Buttons have to be a child elements control
		- The CurrentViewModel property has to be kind of "global", because several other views will need to access it
		- The unused View-s has to be Disposed
		- When switching to an other bigger part (e.g. ExerciseView), the buttons should be replaced with that Views' own buttons
